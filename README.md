## Notes on Submission Packages

*   In any Homework assignment, include all the files for problems due on the same date in the same **.tar** file, NO SUBDIRECTORIES. When the TA's grading script unpacks the file, all the files should be in the directory from which she issued the unpack command. The name of the **.tar** file must be as specified in the course Syllabus.

*   Submit your **.tex** and **.pdf** files, and any image files that a problem might require.

*   Your **.tex** file name should be **Hwkx.tex**, where 'x' is the homework number, e.g. **HwkI.tex** here.

*   Be sure to use exactly the same function names, file names etc. as in the specs!

Here and in future assignments, unless otherwise stated, when asked to find a probability, do so both both analytically (i.e. math) and via R simulation code. In the latter case, again unless directed otherwise, the TA's grading script should be able to run, say for Problem A,

<pre>Rscript ProblemA.R
</pre>

and have the simulation output come out automatically.
